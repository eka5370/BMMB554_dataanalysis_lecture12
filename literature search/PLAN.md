## Goal

Conduct a comprehensive literature search on PFAS in the gut microbiome to determine the impact of PFAS on the gut microbiome with a focus on chronic exposure in humans.

## Implementation

- Search articles published within the last 10 years from reputable, peer-reviewed, scientific journals on PFAS in the gut microbiome
- Use MCP servers for resources looked at
- Create a markdown file with a paragraph per paper which contains
    - Paper title
    - Link to resource
    - Short description
    - DOI
- For each paper validated to ensure that, in fact, this link points to this paper and so on.
